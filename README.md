# WeatherApp
Simple node.js program to display temperature, windspeed and pressure value using OpenWeatherMap API by getting input from the user

* The code defines some constants, including the API key and base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API.
* It creates a readline interface to interact with the user through the command line.
* The getUserOption function displays a menu of options to the user and prompts them to choose one.
* Depending on the userâ€™s choice, the function will either prompt the user for a date and call the getWeatherData function with the appropriate parameters, or exit the program.
* The getWeatherData function makes an HTTPS request to the OpenWeatherMap API using the base URL and retrieves weather data for London.
* It then parses the JSON response and searches for weather data for the specified date.
* If data is found, it displays the temperature, wind speed, or pressure (depending on the type parameter) to the user.
* If no data is found, it displays an error message.

Overall, this code provides a simple command-line interface for retrieving and displaying weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API
